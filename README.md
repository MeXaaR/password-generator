## Why this project ?

When I created this simple app, I had a password manager like the rest of us. But I didn't know my passwords and I had no way to remember it without the password manager plugin. So I imagined a way to be able to find my passwords by myself if I don't have the app in front of me and a few hours later, SPCG was there. Easy but secured passwords.

What? You don't like the name ? Ok, We can change it, no problem.

## How does it works ?

This is a simple way to remember your password without dependind on an online service. You take a text of 208 character minimum. Every space will be filled with a number starting from 0.

This will generate a card you can easily reproduce on a paper without this app. This card is for 16 character long passwords maximum. Then, you take a word for each website (name, domain, anything) to generate your password. First letter on the first row, second letter on the second row and so on.

This method gives you the opportunity to be detached from web password managers and have easy but secured passwords.
You can still use this app. Your text will be stored in your browser and it will ready to run new passwords everytime you hit it. It is free, there is no database, nothing is stored on a server. Use it as you pleased. You can even install it on you android phone
